Assignment 5: These should be as long as they need to be (please be kind to your poor instructor).

Exploration (bivariate+) â€“ 

	Essentially the same as the last assignment, but now with two or more variables. This could include:
		1) Scatterplots
		2) Multidimensional barcharts
		3) Correlation tables
		4) Crosstabs
		5) Anything else you feel is relevant (but not linear or logistic regression yet)

This exploration serves to identify what variables should/should not be included in the next step. No linear or logistic regression quite yet!

Assignments can be submitted as PDF, DOC, DOCX, or plain text form via 2VU.
