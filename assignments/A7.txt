Assignment 7: These should be as long as they need to be (please be kind to your poor instructor).

Communication is key - 

	Briefly, explain what you did and how it relates back to your problem. 

	This needs to be scaled to the audience that you would present these findings to. 
		- If the problem is a statistically technical one, then you would likely present to a quantitatively sophisticated audience. 
		- If, however, the problem is more of a “boots on the ground” problem, then you may need to scale back on the quantitative focus and instead lean into the “TLDR version”.
