Assignment 6: These should be as long as they need to be (please be kind to your poor instructor).

It's modeling time â€“ 

	Using multiple linear regression or multiple logistic regression (or something else discussed with instructor previously), model the relations between the Outcome/s(DV/s) and the Predictors(IVs). This will likely include multiple models that will be compared in order to assess the balance between parsimony and predictive power. 

Explain how you chose the "final" model you did.
